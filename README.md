üèôÔ∏è 311 NYC Service Requests Analysis

üìã Project Overview

New York City is home to millions of residents, and every day, thousands of 311 service requests are made concerning various issues‚Äîranging from noise complaints and broken streetlights to sanitation problems. This project dives into the 311 NYC Service Request data, with the goal of helping city agencies, planners, and administrators understand the types of issues New Yorkers face most frequently. Ultimately, this analysis aims to improve resource allocation, streamline response times, and enhance the quality of life in the city.

This project focuses on answering the following key questions:

Which borough efficiently handles the most service requests?

What are the most common types of agency requests made by residents?

Leveraging Google BigQuery, SQL, Python, and Tableau, this analysis builds an interactive dashboard to provide real-time insights into service request trends. This helps city agencies make data-driven decisions, leading to a better-managed city.

üöÄ Use Case

1. Agency Requests and Service Efficiency
New York City agencies face the challenge of handling overwhelming numbers of service requests each day. This project identifies:

The agencies receiving the most requests.
The types of issues reported most frequently (e.g., noise complaints, sanitation violations).
The average time taken to resolve these requests.
With this analysis, city agencies can prioritize resources more effectively and improve the efficiency of their service delivery.

2. Identifying the Best Borough in New York
Each borough of New York City faces its own set of unique challenges. This project helps identify:

Which boroughs generate the most service requests.
How efficiently boroughs resolve these issues by measuring the average resolution time.
The types of complaints that are most common in each borough, providing a deeper understanding of local needs.
This analysis enables city planners to highlight the boroughs that are performing the best and pinpoint areas where improvements are needed.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

1. Google BigQuery
Handling a large dataset such as the 311 NYC Service Requests requires robust tools. Google BigQuery was used to:

Query the dataset for meaningful patterns from millions of rows of data.
Perform complex SQL queries to aggregate data based on boroughs, agencies, and request types.
2. SQL
SQL was essential for:

Data extraction: Pulling the most relevant data for analysis from Google BigQuery.
Aggregation and Summarization: Grouping the data by categories like borough, agency, and complaint type to understand service request trends.

3. Python
Python was crucial for:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, dealing with duplicates, and transforming columns for better analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to understand relationships between variables, detect trends, and clean up the dataset for dashboarding.
Python provided a deep dive into the data, allowing for detailed exploration before visualization in Tableau.

4. Tableau and Tableau Prep
Tableau and Tableau Prep played key roles in:

Building Interactive Dashboards: A visually appealing, real-time dashboard was built using Tableau, providing an at-a-glance understanding of the service request trends, borough performance, and agency efficiency.

Data Preparation: Tableau Prep was used for additional data cleaning, shaping, and aggregation before loading the data into Tableau for visualization.

üìä Key Insights & Results

1. Agency Performance:
Top Agencies: The New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Department of Sanitation handled the bulk of requests, with noise complaints and sanitation violations topping the list.
Response Time: Emergency-related complaints, such as those handled by the FDNY, showed quicker resolution times compared to non-emergency issues.
2. Borough Trends:
Most Active Boroughs: Manhattan and Brooklyn generated the highest number of service requests, dominated by noise and building complaints.
Best-Performing Borough: Staten Island, while generating fewer requests overall, showed the best response times, suggesting better resource management for service requests.
3. Top Request Types:
Noise Complaints: These were the most frequent requests across all boroughs, often linked to nightlife, construction, and public disturbances.
Sanitation Issues: Sanitation violations and illegal dumping were other common requests, particularly in residential neighborhoods.
üìà Tableau Dashboard
The final interactive dashboard built in Tableau offers a clear and actionable overview of:

Service Request Volume: The number of service requests across various boroughs.
Resolution Times: The average closure time by request type and agency.
Real-Time Request Status: A dynamic view of current active requests and their statuses.
This dashboard is designed to be easily accessible by city officials, enabling them to identify pressing issues and allocate resources where they are needed most.

üìù How to Run the Project
Step 1: Data Preprocessing Using Google BigQuery and SQL
The raw 311 service request data was queried and filtered using Google BigQuery. SQL queries were used to:

Extract relevant data fields.
Aggregate records by borough, agency, and complaint type.
Remove any duplicate entries or incomplete records.
Step 2: Data Cleaning and EDA in Python
Using Python and libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the dataset was further cleaned and explored. This process involved:

Handling missing values through imputation.
Removing unnecessary columns and transforming categorical data.
Visualizing the data to understand key trends and relationships.
The data was processed and exported for visualization in Tableau.

Step 3: Data Preparation with Tableau Prep
Before visualization in Tableau, Tableau Prep was used to:

Refine the data by reshaping and aggregating it for analysis.
Prepare it for Tableau dashboards by ensuring data consistency and reducing any redundancies.
Step 4: Building the Dashboard in Tableau
Once the data was cleaned and ready, it was loaded into Tableau, where interactive dashboards were built to visualize:

Service request trends by borough.
The efficiency of various agencies in handling requests.
The types of complaints received across different areas of New York City.
Step 5: Interpreting the Results
The results of this analysis provide valuable insights into how city agencies and boroughs are managing 311 service requests. Agencies can use this data to improve their response times, allocate resources more effectively, and address the most frequent issues reported by residents.

üìå Future Improvements
Predictive Analytics: Incorporating machine learning to predict future service request trends based on historical data.
Enhanced Visualizations: Adding more granular visualizations to show request trends by time of day or seasonality.
Integrating Additional Datasets: Expanding the analysis by including related datasets such as weather or traffic to understand how external factors influence service requests.
